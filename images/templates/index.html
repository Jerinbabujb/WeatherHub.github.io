    <p><b>Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing</b>,<i> longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters,</i> or entire works. Because they connect the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension.
